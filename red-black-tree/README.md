#### red black tree

> cpp macro implementation of left-leaning 2-3 red-black trees.  Parent
> pointers are not used, and color bits are stored in the least significant
> bit of right-child pointers (if RB_COMPACT is defined), thus making node
> linkage as compact as is possible for red-black trees.
